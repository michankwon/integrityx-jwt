# IntegrityX - Simple Project Guide

## 🎯 What is IntegrityX?

IntegrityX is a **digital document notarization platform** that uses blockchain technology to make documents tamper-proof and verifiable. Think of it like a digital notary that can't be fooled or hacked.

### In Simple Terms:
- **Upload a document** → **Get a digital seal** → **Anyone can verify it's real**
- Like putting a document in a bulletproof safe that everyone can check but no one can break into

---

## 🏢 Who Can Use This?

- **Banks** - For loan documents
- **Lawyers** - For legal contracts  
- **Insurance Companies** - For claims and policies
- **Government Agencies** - For official records
- **Any Business** - For important documents that need to be secure

---

## 🔐 What Makes It Special?

### 1. **Quantum-Safe Security** (Future-Proof)
- Protects against future super-computers that could break current security
- Like having a lock that even future technology can't pick

### 2. **Blockchain Technology**
- Documents are stored on a network of computers worldwide
- Impossible to fake or change once sealed
- Like having thousands of witnesses to your document

### 3. **Multiple Security Levels**
- **Standard**: Good for most documents
- **Maximum Security**: For very important documents
- **Quantum-Safe**: For documents that need to stay secure for decades

## 🚀 How to Use IntegrityX

### **Step 1: Upload a Document**
1. Go to the Upload page
2. Choose your document (PDF, Word, Excel, etc.)
3. Fill in basic information about the document
4. Choose security level (Standard, Maximum, or Quantum-Safe)
5. Click "Upload & Seal"

### **Step 2: Document Gets Sealed**
1. System calculates a unique "fingerprint" of your document
2. Creates a digital signature that proves it's authentic
3. Stores the fingerprint on the blockchain (permanent record)
4. Sends you a confirmation with transaction details

### **Step 3: Verify Documents**
1. Anyone can upload the same document
2. System checks if the fingerprint matches
3. Shows verification results (Real/Fake/Tampered)
4. Displays when and where it was originally sealed

## 🛡️ Security Features Explained Simply

### **Document Fingerprinting**
- Every document gets a unique "fingerprint" (like a human fingerprint)
- Even changing one letter creates a completely different fingerprint
- Impossible to fake or duplicate

### **Blockchain Sealing**
- Your document's fingerprint is stored on thousands of computers worldwide
- No single person or company controls it
- Once stored, it can never be changed or deleted

### **Quantum-Safe Protection**
- Current security might be broken by future super-computers
- Our system uses "quantum-safe" methods that even future computers can't break
- Your documents stay secure for decades

### **Encryption**
- Sensitive information (like Social Security numbers) is scrambled
- Only authorized people can unscramble it
- Even if someone steals the data, they can't read it

- Node.js (for the web interface) installed

### **Simple Setup Steps**

#### **1. Backend Setup**
```bash
# Go to the backend folder
cd backend

# Install required software
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Create environment file with passwords
# (Copy the example and add your passwords)

# Start the backend server
python main.py
```

# Go to the frontend folder
cd frontend

# Install required software
npm install

# Start the web interface
npm run dev
```

#### **3. Access the System**
- Open your web browser
- Go to `http://localhost:3000`
- Start uploading and sealing documents!

---

## 🧪 Testing the System

### **Test with Sample Files**
1. Use `sample-simple.json` - A simple loan document
2. Use `test-quantum-safe.json` - A document with advanced security
3. Try uploading the same file twice - should detect it's already sealed

### **What to Look For**
- ✅ Upload completes successfully
- ✅ You get a transaction ID (like a receipt number)
- ✅ Document appears in your documents list
- ✅ Verification works when you re-upload the same file

---

## 🚨 Common Issues and Solutions

### **"Can't Connect to Server"**
- Make sure the backend is running (`python main.py`)
- Check that port 8000 is not being used by another program

### **"Upload Failed"**
- Check your internet connection
- Make sure the file isn't too large (max 50MB)
- Try a different file format

### **"Document Already Exists"**
- This is normal! It means the document was already sealed
- You can still verify it or view its details

### **"Security Error"**
- Check your `.env` file has the correct passwords
- Make sure you're using the right security settings
