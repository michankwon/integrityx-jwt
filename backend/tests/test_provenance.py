Loan Lifecycle Provenance Test - IntegrityX Demo

This script demonstrates a complete loan lifecycle with provenance tracking
from original loan application through servicing transfer. It shows how
document relationships are maintained throughout the entire loan process.

Perfect for demos and presentations!
